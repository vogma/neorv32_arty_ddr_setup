# Arty-A7 DDR3 Integration into NEORV32 Softcore Processor

The [NEORV32](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32) is a Softcore Processor written entirely in VHDL and very well documented. In its default configuration only on-chip FPGA RAM is used for IMEM (Instruction Memory) and DMEM (Data Memory).
This is a very reasonable choice, because using off-chip memory, like DDR, requires proprietary IP from the FPGA Vendor. By using only on-chip Memory of the FPGA (BRAM), which is inferred by the platform independant VHDL Code, NEORV32 can be used on a wide variety of FPGA Platforms.

The goal of this project is to connect the NEORV32 to the external DDR3 Memory of the [Arty A7-100T](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/arty-a7/start) FPGA Board. The NEORV32 Softcore can address 32 bits of Memory Space (4GB), which makes more than capable to integrate the 256MB of DDR3 Memory into its memory space.

This picture shows the block diagram of the Vivado Project. The NEORV32 Softcore, more specifically the AXI_Lite Wrapper which can be found [here](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/blob/main/rtl/system_integration/neorv32_SystemTop_axi4lite.vhd), is instatiated as an IP Module. The communication with the DDR PHY is controlled via the Memory Interface Generator IP (MIG). It is supplied with a reference clock (`clk_ref_i`) of 200 MHz and a system clk (`sys_clk_i`) of 166.67 MHz. These clocks are generated by the Clocking Wizard IP Module. The MIG generates a clock itself, `ui_clk`, which is used as the clock input for all other Modules used. 
The NEORV32 Softcore is connected to an AXI Smartconnect module which enabels the connection of multiple AXI Slaves to the AXI Master port of the processor. In this example, the Softcore is connected to the MIG, which in turn is connected to the DDR3 RAM, and to an AXI_GPIO IP Module. 

## Address Map
In order to make these Modules accessible to the Softcore and the Software running on it, the DDR RAM and the GPIO Module have to be mapped into the address space of the Processor. NEORV32 has 32 address bits and can therefore address up to four GB of memory so it is more than capable to incorporate the 256 MB of external DDR RAM. The following image depicts the [address space](https://stnolting.github.io/neorv32/#_address_space) of the NEORV32 Processor:

Some memory regions are reserved for processor internal memories like the bootloader or the internal data and instruction memory. But a lot of memory space is no preoccupied and therefore free to be used. As stated in the documentation a memory access to one of these "void" regions will be redirected to the external memory bus. 

The address map of the modules used in this example project is listed in the following table:
| Memory Map | Start Address | Size | High Address |
|------------|---------------|------|--------------|
| DDR        | 0x1000_0000   | 256M | 0x1FFF_FFFF  |
| GPIO       | 0x4000_0000   | 64K  | 0x4000_FFFF  |

This memory map is configured via the AXI Smartconnect

So a write to address 0x10000000 is forwarded to the external memory bus which is then routed through the AXI Smartconnect to the MIG IP where it is sent to the DDR PHY. With the provided [bus_explorer](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/tree/main/sw/example/bus_explorer) example, located in `neorv32/sw/example/bus_explorer`, the funcionality of the project can be tested by writing and reading memory locations located within the address map of the DDR.

The first three LED's of the Arty A7 are also memory mapped via the AXI_GPIO Module. So if you write the byte 0x01 to address 0x4000_0000 the first LED will light up and so on.
(The fourth LED is connected to the `init_calib_done` signal of the mig and indicates that the calibration of the ddr memory is finished)

#### Disclaimer 
This integration of the external DDR memory is more a proof of concept and can't be used conveniently with compiled C code because the processor will use it's enabled internal IMEM and DMEM. In a future project I plan to use the external DDR as the main memory of the Softcore and evaluate the performance differences.

## Setup

Vivado v2020.2 is used in this project. To create the project files, execute following command:

`vivado -mode batch -source neorv32_arty_ddr.tcl -nojournal -nolog`
